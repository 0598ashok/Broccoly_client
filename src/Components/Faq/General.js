                    In order to provide you with a wide range of meals which can
                    be stored suitably, and also reheated easily, our team have
                    worked with suppliers to prepare meals using a Sous Vide
                    method of cooking.

                  <div class="card-body">
                    Sous Vide is French for "under vacuum". It is a method of
                    cooking in which food is sealed in airtight packing then
                    placed in a temperature-controlled steam environment. The
                    intent is to cook the item evenly, ensuring that the inside
                    is properly cooked without overcooking the outside, and
                    retain moisture.
                  </div>
                  <div class="card-body">
                    Because it is sealed in the packages, the aromatics are
                    retained, not lost in the steam. The cooking process ensures
                    that the food is totally cleared of any bacteria, which
                    makes the food safe for long periods, without the use of
                    unnecessary preservatives.

                    Most healthy people can meet their nutritional needs through
                    eating a varied, balanced diet. Your diet should include

                    different nutrients. This means that the nutrient content of
