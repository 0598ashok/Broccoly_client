              (e) If you cancel the contract in accordance with this section 7,
              we will refund you the amount you paid for the products or
              Subscription Programme that you selected and the associated
              delivery charge. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we may deduct from
              your refund amount: (i) any collection charges where we collect
              the goods from you; and (ii) the amount by which the value of the
              goods is diminished as a result of any handling of the goods by
              you subject to an allowance for consumption of one full day's
              worth of food. You will be responsible for paying the cost of
              returning the products or Subscription Programme meal box to us at
              the address set out on our returns form.
            </p>
            <p>
              (f) If you cancel your contract in accordance with this section 7
              and you are entitled to a refund, we will issue your refund to you
              using the same method originally used by you to pay for your
              purchase unless we have, at our sole discretion, agreed to refund
              you using another method. We will process the refund due to you
              within 14 days of the day we received the goods from you, less any
              deductions we are entitled to make.
            </p>
            <p>
              (g) As an alternative to cancellation, if you would like to
              downgrade your product selection (e.g. if you are on a 4, 3 or
              2-month Subscription Programme and you want to switch to a 1-month
              programme), then we may charge you an adjusting payment to reflect
              the cost of the plan you are switching to at its standard
              (non-promotional) rate.

              8. Automatic renewals and terminating your Subscription Programme
            </h1>
            <p>
              (a) All Subscription Programmes will automatically renew at the
              end of the Minimum Period for successive rolling 28 day periods,
              unless and until terminated by you in accordance with this section
            </p>
            <p>
              (b) Meals will continue to be dispatched automatically and we will
              bill the applicable monthly fee via your payment method on an
              on-going basis, unless and until you contact us to terminate your
              Subscription Programme.
            </p>
            <p>
              (c) If you want to terminate your Subscription Programme, you must
              follow the procedure below:
            </p>
            <p className="para_sub">
              (1) You may cancel your Subscription Programme at any time by
              giving us at least 7 working days notice before the next delivery
              is due (which has not already been paid for). If you cancel your
              Subscription Programme within the Minimum Period, you shall be
              charged a Conversion Payment in accordance with section 8(c)(4)
              below. If you are outside of the Minimum Period, our contract will
              terminate on fulfilment of the last paid-for delivery of your
              Subscription Programme and your Subscription Programme will not be
              automatically renewed.
            </p>
            <p className="para_sub">
              (2) For example, if you are on a Subscription Programme with a 3
              month Minimum Period and you want it to terminate at the end of
              the Minimum Period, you must give us your written notice to
              terminate at least 7 working days before your fourth delivery is
              due. If you give us such notice, the plan will terminate at the
              end of the third month. If you do not give such notice, then the
              plan will be automatically renewed for another month and will
              continue to be so renewed until you give us at least 7 working
              days notice before your next unpaid delivery. Once payment has
              been taken for a delivery, it is not possible for you to cancel
              until the next month. On occasion, at our sole discretion and as a
              gesture of goodwill, we may allow a cancellation within the 7
              working days notice period. If this situation occurs and payment
              has been made by you, we will charge a fee for the processing of a
              refund and any costs relating to the recovery and unpacking of
              your delivery.
            </p>
            <p className="para_sub">
              (3) Your next delivery date can be found in your Account area on
              our Website. Where you have served valid notice to terminate, we
              will continue to make deliveries until such notice takes effect
              and you will continue to be charged your monthly fee in respect of
              those deliveries.
            </p>
            <p className="para_sub">
              (4) If you want to terminate a Subscription Programme before
              completion of its Minimum Period, you will need to make an
              additional adjusting payment ("Conversion Payment"). Plans are
              normally discounted according to duration; the longer the plan you
              purchased, the bigger the discount. The Conversion Payment will
              therefore be calculated to bring the total amount paid up to what
              would have been paid if the relevant, shorter duration had been
              selected at time of order in line with the actual number of months
              completed. For example, a 4-month programme terminated prematurely
              after two payments (and two deliveries) will incur a charge to
              bring the total amount paid up to the price for two deliveries on
              our 2-month programme, as advertised on our Website at time of
              ordering.
            </p>
            <p className="para_sub">
              (5) To cancel your Programme after completion of your Minimum
              Period, go to your Account area and follow the instructions for
              cancellation. Alternatively, email, call or write to us using the
              contact details in section 2 above. If you are using the postal
              system, we recommend that you allow sufficient time for us to
              receive your correspondence when considering the minimum notice
              requirements and obtain proof of posting.

            <h1>11. Exchanges</h1>
            <p>
              We are happy to exchange any meals within a Subscription
              Programme, provided you let us know within 14 days of delivery. We
              will email you a 'Swap Form' asking you to provide us with the
              items you are returning and what you would like in their place.
              Send the form back to us via email, and print one to include in
              the box you return to us. Then simply package up the meals (making
              sure they're well wrapped and protected) and send to the address
              detailed on the form. You need to return the meals you want to
              exchange to us sealed, unopened and in perfect condition.
              Replacement items will be sent out at your expense and delivery
              will automatically be charged to your payment method.
              Alternatively, you can request that we include replacements in
              your next delivery (if you have a next delivery scheduled and you
              indicate that you would like us to do that on your Swap Form).

              under these terms and conditions, or if we do not enforce our
              rights against you, or if we delay in doing so, that will not mean
              that we have waived our rights against you and will not mean that
              you do not have to comply with those obligations. If we do waive a
              default by you, we will only do so in writing, and that will not
              mean that we will automatically waive any later default by you.
