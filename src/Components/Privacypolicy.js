                      these messages are delivered by email, and every account
                      is required to keep a valid email address on file to
                      receive messages. Diet Chef may also contact you by
                      telephone to provide customer support or for
                      transaction-related purposes if you request that we call
                      you. Additionally, and with your consent, Diet Chef may
                      send you an SMS (or similar) message or physical mail in

                      website or service, such as a “Like” or “Send” button, you
                      are also loading content from that third-party website.

                      third-party websites or services, their own terms and

                      technologies placed on its Websites and Apps. However,
                      these are third-party technologies, and they are subject
                      to that third party's privacy policy. We rely on your
