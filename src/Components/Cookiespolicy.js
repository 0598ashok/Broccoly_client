                      Cookies are tiny text files stored on your computer when
                      you visit certain web pages. They are stored in your
                      browser’s cache and allow a website or a third party to
                      recognise your browser. Cookies can’t harm your computer.
                      We don’t store personally identifiable information such as
                      credit card details in cookies we create, but we do use
                      encrypted information gathered from them to help improve
                      your experience of the site. For example, they help us to

                      In addition to cookies, there are other similar

                          <b>Web beacons</b>: These are tiny graphics (sometimes
                          called “clear GIFs” or “web pixels”) with a unique
                          identifier that are used to understand browsing
                          activity. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on
                          a user's computer hard drive, web beacons are rendered
                          invisibly on web pages when you open a page.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          <b>Social widgets</b>: These are buttons or icons
                          provided by third-party social media providers that
                          allow you to interact with those social media services
                          when you view a web page or a mobile app screen. These
                          social widgets may collect browsing data, which may be
                          received by the third party that provided the widget,
                          and are controlled by the third parties.

                        <li>
                          <b>UTM codes</b>: These are strings that can appear in
                          a URL (the “Uniform Resource Locator”,which is
                          typically the http or https address entered to go to a
                          web page) when a user moves from one web page or
                          website to another, where the string can represent
                          information about browsing, such as which
                          advertisement, page, or publisher sent the user to the
                          receiving website.

                          your browser by a site or app. They can be used to
                          maintain preferences, maintain a history of usage, or

                      Ambient meals, or 'shelf-stable meals', are meals that can
                      be safely stored at room temperature for use before their
                      best-before date.
